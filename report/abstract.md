# Abstract
We consider the problem of musical time series prediction. Specifically, we
attempt to finish an unfinished work by Johann Sebastian Bach, namely an
unfinished fugue from The Art of Fugue. For this purpose, we try out several
machine learning methods: window-based linear regression, Hidden Markov Models,
and (optionally) recurrent neural networks. We dicuss the pros and cons of
each method and qualitatively analyze the results for each method.
